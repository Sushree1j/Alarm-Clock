# Secure Alarm Clock App - Project Specification

## Overview
An Android alarm application with advanced security features where only the alarm creator can dismiss the alarm using their authentication method. The app ensures the alarm continues running in the background even if users attempt to close it without proper authentication.

## Core Features

### 1. Alarm Creation with Authentication Setup
- **Multiple Authentication Options:**
  - PIN (4-6 digits)
  - Password (alphanumeric)
  - Fingerprint authentication
  - Pattern lock
- **Setup Process:**
  - User creates alarm with standard time/date settings
  - System prompts to choose authentication method
  - User sets up their preferred authentication
  - Alarm is saved with encrypted authentication data

### 2. Secure Alarm Dismissal System
- **Authentication Required:**
  - Only the alarm creator can dismiss the alarm
  - Authentication prompt appears when dismissal is attempted
  - Multiple failed attempts can trigger additional security measures
- **Persistent Alarm Behavior:**
  - Alarm continues in background if dismissed without authentication
  - Visual and audio notifications persist until proper authentication
  - Non-authenticated users see dismissal option but it doesn't actually stop the alarm

### 3. Non-Intrusive Design
- **Background Operation:**
  - Alarm runs as a foreground service
  - Other phone functions remain fully accessible
  - Phone calls, messages, and other apps work normally
- **User Experience:**
  - Alarm overlay appears on screen
  - Users can navigate to other apps while alarm continues
  - Clear visual indication that alarm is active

### 4. Notification Management
- **Persistent Notification:**
  - Alarm shows in notification bar
  - Notification cannot be dismissed without authentication
  - Swipe-to-dismiss triggers authentication prompt
- **Security Features:**
  - Notification shows alarm is active
  - Authentication required to interact with notification
  - Clear indication of security protection

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Android Components Needed

#### Services
- **Foreground Service:** For persistent alarm operation
- **Alarm Manager:** For scheduling alarms
- **Media Player Service:** For alarm sound playback

#### Security
- **Biometric Authentication:** For fingerprint support
- **Keystore Integration:** For secure credential storage
- **Encryption:** For storing authentication data

#### UI Components

```

### 3. Key Classes and Architecture

#### Core Classes
- `AlarmEntity`: Data model for alarm with authentication
- `AuthenticationManager`: Handles all authentication methods
- `AlarmService`: Foreground service for alarm operation
- `AlarmReceiver`: Broadcast receiver for alarm triggers
- `SecurityManager`: Manages encryption and secure storage

#### Activities
- `MainActivity`: Main alarm list and creation
- `AlarmSetupActivity`: Alarm creation with authentication setup
- `AlarmDismissalActivity`: Authentication prompt for dismissal
- `AlarmOverlayActivity`: Full-screen alarm display

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### 1. Alarm Creation Flow
1. User opens app and taps "Create Alarm"
2. Standard alarm settings (time, date, repeat, sound)
3. Security setup screen appears
4. User selects authentication method:
   - **PIN:** Enter and confirm 4-6 digit PIN
   - **Password:** Enter and confirm alphanumeric password
   - **Fingerprint:** Register fingerprint (if device supports)
   - **Pattern:** Draw and confirm unlock pattern
5. Authentication data is encrypted and stored securely
6. Alarm is scheduled and saved

### 2. Alarm Triggering Behavior
1. Alarm triggers at scheduled time
2. Foreground service starts with high priority
3. Full-screen overlay appears with alarm interface
4. Persistent notification created
5. Audio/vibration starts
6. System prevents easy dismissal without authentication

### 3. Dismissal Attempt Handling
1. User taps "Dismiss" or "Stop" button
2. Authentication prompt appears
3. User enters credentials:
   - **Success:** Alarm stops completely
   - **Failure:** Error message, alarm continues
   - **Cancel:** Returns to alarm screen, alarm continues
4. Failed attempts are logged
5. After multiple failures, additional security measures may activate

### 4. Background Persistence
1. If user navigates away or tries to close app:
   - Alarm continues running in background service
   - Notification remains visible and active
   - Audio continues at set volume
2. Service is protected as foreground service
3. System cannot easily kill the service
4. Alarm restarts if system attempts to stop it

### 5. Notification Bar Integration
1. Persistent notification shows:
   - Alarm name/time
   - "Tap to dismiss" option
   - Security lock icon
2. Tapping notification triggers authentication
3. Swiping to dismiss triggers authentication
4. Notification cannot be removed without proper auth

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- All authentication data encrypted using Android Keystore
- Biometric data stored securely by system
- No plain text storage of credentials
- Secure deletion of sensitive data

### 2. Anti-Tampering Measures
- Service restart capability if killed
- Protection against force-stop attempts
- Secure storage prevents data modification
- Root detection (optional) for enhanced security

### 3. Privacy Protection
- Authentication data never leaves device
- No network transmission of credentials
- Local-only operation for security features
- Clear privacy policy for users

## User Interface Design

### 1. Main Interface
- Clean, modern alarm list
- Easy alarm creation button
- Security indicator for each alarm
- Settings and help sections

### 2. Alarm Creation
- Intuitive time/date picker
- Clear authentication setup flow
- Visual feedback for security setup
- Help text for each authentication method

### 3. Alarm Display
- Full-screen alarm interface
- Large dismiss button
- Snooze option (with authentication)
- Clear security indicators

### 4. Authentication Prompts
- Consistent design across all auth methods
- Clear error messages
- Retry options
- Cancel/back navigation

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE alarms (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    time TEXT NOT NULL,
    date TEXT,
    repeat_pattern TEXT,
    sound_uri TEXT,
    auth_method TEXT NOT NULL,
    auth_data BLOB, -- Encrypted
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    created_timestamp INTEGER
);
```

### 2. Encryption Strategy
- Use Android Keystore for key generation
- AES-256 encryption for authentication data
- Biometric-protected keys where available
- Salt and hash for PIN/password storage

### 3. Service Architecture
